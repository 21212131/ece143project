ECE 143 Project Proposal
Group 4 - Arik Horodniceanu, Chi Zhang, Changhao Shi 

    1. Topic: 
Financial Career Consulting - Helping high-school students decide on career and college choices based on average graduate salaries.

We are trying to answer 3 main questions. First, Which major pays the most, and how do the results differ over time? Second, Which geographical area pays the most? Is it more economic to go to a public school rather than private school? If time allowed we will rank schools based on Return on Investment (ROI). And build a content based school recommendation system based on studentâ€™s preferences.

    2. DataSet:
